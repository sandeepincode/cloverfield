# Cloverfield

It is in Java, don't be a hater.

## What is it?
Right... so the yeah is 2050 and we fucked it. Monsters are loose. This game is the solution to how we 
will save the human race against the intersellar monsters battle. 

### What actually is it?
A "simulation" where we have X number of cities and those cities have connections to other cities, yes...no shit.
Randomly spawn N number of monster and let them loooooooose.

### Will it run?
If you take the effort to run it, then yes. But yes, I did cba to make a .jar file.

### Issues?
The game will finish but it will not exit the loop since the monsters list is size 1 
and it has no monters left to battle, but the monster is set to dead when it hits 10k moves. 
To fix this add a f**king variable, cause I cba to do it.
